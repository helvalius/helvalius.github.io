In the first dojo of 2014 on Thursday 16th  we continue working on the Potter Kata.

During the last dojo we had the impression that this kata focusses more on algorithmic design. 
Each kata always has a breaking point at which on needs to review and rethink the own solution. The Potter Kata has a tricky breaking point as one thinks more about finding the correct algorithm than the code itself. 

A developer should be already aware of clean coding and test-driven development to be really able to do and comprehend each step in my opinion. It is more of an algorithmic puzzle than getting into the flow of coding before working on production code.
