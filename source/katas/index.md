# Coding Kata
A coding Kata is a simple problem that one can solve using TDD techniques. These exercises help to practice unit testing and test driven development, as well as development with various programming languages. 
I think all programmers have seen the “Hello World” coding kata. In the following I'll present a small list of Katas that can be used to practise.
The idea is to do a task regularly, so that it functions like a warm up practice in sports. If you live near Bonn, come visit us at a [Coding Dojo](http://bit.ly/codingdojobn) where we work together on a selected Kata.
