  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What is a Coding Dojo</h2>

<p>A Coding Dojo is a developer meet-up in which they work together in a pre-selected small programming challenge. This is a great way for developers to improve their skills and it&rsquo;s a great activity to encourage learning between developers. Especially in our case, we wanted to have an environment where our students and developers working in companies can learn together and from each other.</p>

<p>During a Code Dojo we work in pairs, using Test-Driven-Development (aka Test-Driven-Design) and adhering to the Clean Code principles in order to solve a problem. These problems are referred to as coding katas as they are meant to be exercised repeatedly and offer learning as well as discussion opportunities. The focus is not on completing the kata in the time available, but rather doing the best that we can, and improving our practice of the above techniques in doing so.</p>

<h2>The Bonn Coding Dojo</h2>

<p>The first Bonn Coding Dojo meeting was on Thursday the 18th. Six people showed up, more than I expected for the first meet-up. The agenda was introduction, selection of a kata to work on and a retrospective at the end. After the introduction we selected the tennis game kata for the coding part.</p>

<h2>What is the Tennis Game Kata</h2>

<p>The tennis kata is  a simplified tennis game adopted from Wii sports. A game consists only of a single set.
&ndash; A player can have points 0 (love), 15 (fifteen), 30 (thirty) or 40 (forty).
&ndash; If a player has 40 points and wins the ball she wins the game.
&ndash; If both have 40 it is a &ldquo;deuce&rdquo;. If the game is in deuce, the player winning the next ball has &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; and a game ball. If the player with advantage wins the ball, she wins the game. If the other player wins they are back at deuce.</p>

<h2>Retrospective</h2>

<p>In the end we had three different approaches with all three pairs using Java as implementation language. In between we swapped pairs twice. One group for example introduced a class to deal with counting the score. Another group translated a counter for representing the tennis points. Overall we had a lot of fun dealing with this kata and all agreed to to the same kata again in the next meeting.</p>

<p>Questions and ideas that came up in the retrospective:
&ndash; What about negative tests and invalid game states?
&ndash; Is the tennis game class doing too much? What about an immutable score object?
&ndash; Are the tennis game rules at a glance readable and recognizable from the source code?</p>

<h2>Personal Feedback for the next meet-up</h2>

<p>This was the first Coding Dojo that I organized, overall I was satisfied with how it worked out, but as always one finds things in which one can improve. I wanted to swap three times, as we had three pairs, but missed taking a look at the time in between. Next time I would like to do the pair sessions with a pomodoro timer, this way all have the same amount of time and a reminder when to switch. Maybe even start at some point to say that we delete all code after a pomodoro so that we could start fresh.</p>

<p>Sometimes I had the impression that we spent too much time on design discussions in a pair when we should have spent the time to implement our ideas in code. The number one rule in a coding dojo: There is only code, and code doesn&rsquo;t exist without tests.</p>

<p>In the future I would like to create and show a basic set of slides in the beginning to remind everyone of the rules and give the meeting a formal frame. I came up with this after taking a look what great working Sleepyfox is doing for the London Coding Dojo. His slides can be seen on speakersdeck: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sleepyfox.">https://speakerdeck.com/sleepyfox.</a> This standard fits into the idea behind katas and would give all participants a well-known framework to work in. Furthermore, after looking at the slides from Sleepyfox, I realized that I still need a banner/logo for putting on the slides and the google+ group.</p>

<h2>Bonn Coding Dojo August</h2>

<p>The next Coding Dojo is set for Thursday the 15th August, we will meet again to work on the Tennis Kata in the RÃ¶merstrasse 164, A121 at 18:30 till 20:30.  Ideas for a pub  that we can visit after the dojo welcome! :)  Maybe we move to the B-IT building in the Dahlmannstrasse 2  during August/September, as I&rsquo;m working there in a university lab course fulltime during the time period.</p>

<p>All interested students or developers are welcome! I&rsquo;ll post the event in the Coding Dojo Bonn Google+ Community at the beginning of August.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t make it, don&rsquo;t worry. The plan is to organize (based on interest) at least a dojo per month. The monthly meeting will be on the 3rd Thursday each month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For each game there is a specific set of cards. Half of these can be earned randomly while playing (up until now) the participating game. The other half is earned only through trading with other players, either directly or via a market place.
After completing a set of cards, one can craft them into a game badge. These badges can be shown on the Steam profile, but one can also gain random goodies for crafting. These can be coupons and discounts for Steam games or background images for the Steam profil.
Through these badges and rewards, a player can further customize the user profile. This fact is further empowered as one can now gain Steam levels. All badges have a XP value which contributes to the Steam level. Leveling up provides non-tradeable items like profile showcases, additional friend slots, etc.</p>

<p>Taking a look at it from the perspective of <strong>gamification</strong>, this idea and extension of the existing achievement system in Steam is reasonable. Lets look at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test">Bartle character types</a>: Achievers, Explorers, Socializers and Killers.</p>

<p>Valve extended the initial achievement system with the trading cards to incorporate more player styles. The new system requires players to socialize, as they need to trade cards with others to complete their card set. Explorers can play to find rare cards or probably discover hidden badges.
Killers can control the market of the trading cards and can strive on competing for specific cards. Achievers have new card sets and a leveling progressing system that should keep them occupied.</p>

<p>Overall these features bind customers even stronger to the Steam plattform as one collects trading cards and needs to spend playing time to gain some of them. I think this step is reasonable and an interesting approach from Valve to further strengthen the Steam platform.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just today I have added Groovy tests using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spock/">Spock</a> to my maven/tycho build Eclipse plugin. During test migration from <a href="https://github.com/alexruiz/fest-assert-2.x">FEST-Assertions</a> &amp; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito/">Mockito</a> I wondered how argument interception in Spock works.</p>

<p>The easy functional solution (that I didn&rsquo;t directly found on the web) is simple: <strong>Use a closure!</strong></p>

<p>Lets create a simple Person Java class with a name:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">newName</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">newName</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">getName</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With a Java Test using Mockito one would use an ArgumentCaptor to verify that the name should be John:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">ArgumentCaptor</span> <span class="n">argument</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ArgumentCaptor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">forClass</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">verify</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">doSomething</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">capture</span><span class="o">());</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">assertEquals</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">argument</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getValue</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">getName</span><span class="o">());</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So one needs three lines of code to match one expected String. Seems to be quite bloated!</p>

<p>In Spock one can use a Closure to do the same test:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='groovy'><span class='line'>   <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">doSomething</span><span class="o">({</span> <span class="n">it</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">name</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="s2">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="o">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to make sure that you really have a Person, you can also use the explicit Closure:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='groovy'><span class='line'>   <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">doSomething</span><span class="o">({</span> <span class="n">Person</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">name</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="s2">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="o">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
