    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Disclaimer: The following text represents my personal opinion only)</p>

<p>2013 is over and we are approaching the 3-year anniversary with our Bonn Agile meetup in February. A good time to make a retrospective what we did in the last year and maybe think about challenges in the new year.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We had the &ldquo;biggest change&rdquo; of the group so far, in March we changed from meeting on the 3rd Monday of each month to the 1st Tuesday. In August we started to create Google+ Events in addition to Xing and discussed about leaving the mailinglist in favor of the Google+ Community.</p>

<p>We started last year with an introduction to Test-Driven-Development with Spock and continued our testing series later with a focus on web-testing with Geb and in October we had in invited talk by Sebastian Golasch to the JavaScript testing framework DalekJS.
Just based on the topics the year was clearly dominated by tooling and testing. On agile processes we had a talk about Kanban and one about testing in agile projects. This corresponds to the fact that we seem have more developers than coaches in the group.</p>

<p>What I personally like are the casual barmeetups as a change of pace to the presentation oriented meetups. They create in my opinion a nice atmosphere where one can really exchange ideas and we can get to know each other. Still, there shouldn&rsquo;t always be a barmeetup and there shouldn&rsquo;t always be a presentation meetup.
Some of the breaks in between or the barmeetups were used to replace meetups when we didn&rsquo;t have a speaker or location. These two things are the biggest challenges also in 2014! A stale group and a stale set of presenters may lead to less participants.
Also the idea of having the meetup at different companies is on the one side a benefit and on the other side a burden. We don&rsquo;t have the fixed location and setup where everyone knows: &ldquo;if I go there on this Tuesday evening there will be a Bonn Agile meetup either with a presentation or casual meetup&rdquo;.</p>

<p>On the other side, it allows companies to represent themselves as well as to have an easy way of providing topics for employees. As the year went on, I had the impression that the number companies willing to host the meetup declined. We also had the same hosts the year before. So maybe we should think about how to find new companies to host our meetups or why we are not appealing for local agile companies in Bonn. How about being more present at FrOsCon as a group?</p>

<p>Currently our Xing group has 204 members, which is an increase of 46 members since February. Yet, one can&rsquo;t really see a statistical increase in the number of attendants per meetup. I would be really interested in getting to know why people join the group, but don&rsquo;t participate in the meetups. Is it the time, the topics, or the locations?</p>

<p>Also, what other platforms would be the place to be as an agile meetup in Germany? We have already a tons of options that one needs to know when posting an event. Is this diversity good or bad? Maybe we could move under the umbrella of the local Softwerkskammer and use their Agora platform for the events and mailinglist? Does it make sense for us to create events only on one platform exclusively? I don&rsquo;t know what my favorite would be as an answer to this question.</p>

<p>Overall, maybe we don&rsquo;t need to change anything or maybe we just need to advertise more in Bonn what we are. I liked the meetups and hope to still have many more Bonn Agile meetups in the future. We have a good group of members organising the meetups and a nice core of people showing up each month. This is something we can build upon and see what the year brings for the group!</p>
